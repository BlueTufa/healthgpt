# JWT Minter for REST-API Security

This utility provides a way to mint JWT's for test automation and other non-production use, without having to disable JWT authentication in lower environments.  

The [keypair](keypair.jwk) provided is a sample only, and is used for testing purposes only.  Checking secrets in to version control is to be avoided.
